# Khd1_evolution_structure_2021/evolutiona_analysis

Data used for evolutionary analysis and resulting figures

Some analysis are described in files in subdirectories of evolution_analysis

## Khd1_Pbp2_homolog

files of Khd1 and Pbp2 homologs, including the initial dataset and the dataset after domain structure screening

All the homologs are selected from PANTHERDB and OrthorDB
